## Intelligent Parking System Hardware Setup (Arduino Uno/Nano)

**Components:**

* Arduino Uno or Nano microcontroller board
* Two infrared (IR) sensors
* Servo motor
* I2C character display

**Connections:**

1. **IR Sensor (Vehicle Detection):** Connect the "OUT" pin of the first IR sensor to any digital pin between D2 and D11 (pins 2 to 11) on the Arduino.
2. **Servo Motor (Gate Control):** Connect the servo motor control signal pin to digital pin D13 (pin 13) on the Arduino.
3. **I2C Display:** Connect the display's SDA (Serial Data) pin to analog pin A4 (pin 20) and the SCL (Serial Clock) pin to analog pin A5 (pin 21) on the Arduino.
4. **IR Sensor (Gate Activation):** Connect the "OUT" pin of the second IR sensor to digital pin D12 (pin 12) on the Arduino.

**Power Connections:**

* Connect the Vcc (power) and GND (ground) pins of all components to appropriate power and ground rails on the Arduino board, following recommended voltage specifications for each component.

**Note:** While the specific pin assignments for the IR sensors can be chosen within the designated range (D2-D11), ensure consistent pin usage throughout the software implementation.
